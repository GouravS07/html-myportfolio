<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Gourav Sakharkar living a quarter mile away from advait's home who leaves on the bank of the river.</p>

<p>I have done my B. Tech in electrical engineering from a hopeless college of engineering and management, I was fucked off at the time of takin gadmisson, i don't know the fuck happened with me I took the admission over there, and now I am struggling to get into the IT field</p>

<p>Now I am learning Angela Yu's Web Development couse, which will make me a web developer in 45 - 50 sections of the module. Wish me all the best.</p></br>Thankyou
